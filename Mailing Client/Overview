Project Overview
Your project is a Python-based mailing client that uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send emails with attachments. It automates the process of composing and sending emails from a Gmail account to a recipient's address.

Significance of the Project
Automation: This project simplifies email-sending tasks, which can be tedious if done manually, especially for bulk or repetitive emails.
Learning Opportunity: The project enhances your understanding of Python libraries (smtplib for SMTP, email for crafting messages) and file handling.
Customizability: You can modify the script to include additional features, such as multiple recipients, dynamic messages, and scheduling.
Security Awareness: It provides insights into email security, such as the importance of encrypted connections (TLS/SSL) and app passwords.
How the Code Works
The code performs the following steps:

1. Imports Required Libraries:
smtplib: For connecting to the email server and sending emails.
email modules: For crafting MIME-based email messages, handling attachments, and encoding.
2. Set Up SMTP Connection:
The smtplib.SMTP object is initialized with Gmail's SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com) and port 587 for TLS.
The server.ehlo() method signals the server to identify itself.
The server.starttls() method upgrades the connection to a secure TLS/SSL connection.
3. Authenticate Using Credentials:
The script reads the email account password from a local password.txt file.
The server.login() method logs into the Gmail account using the provided credentials.
4. Compose the Email:
Sender and Recipient: The From and To fields specify the sender's and recipient's email addresses.
Subject: The Subject field provides a brief description of the email's purpose.
Body: The email's main text content is read from message.txt and attached to the email as plain text.
Attachment:
The script reads the specified file (Bags.jpeg) in binary mode.
It uses MIMEBase and encoders.encode_base64() to attach the file to the email in a format that email clients can decode.
5. Send the Email:
The server.sendmail() method sends the composed email from the sender to the recipient.
6. Close the Server Connection:
The server.quit() method terminates the connection to the SMTP server.
Example Workflow
Inputs:

A Gmail account (jnjiwa83@gmail.com) and its password (or app password).
Recipient's email address (wangondumercy443@gmail.com).
A message file (message.txt) and an attachment (Bags.jpeg).
Execution:

The script authenticates, reads the inputs, creates a well-structured email, and sends it securely.
Output:

The recipient receives an email with the specified message and attachment.
Potential Applications
Sending automated reminders or notifications.
Distributing reports or files to a group of recipients.
Building more advanced email systems, like newsletters or customer outreach tools.
